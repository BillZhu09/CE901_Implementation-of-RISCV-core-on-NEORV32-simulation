# SOC

SOC, abbreviated as System on Chip, is also referred to as system on a chip. SoC is an imitation of a computer system, miniaturized into a microsystem. In the SOC chips I have contacted, the hardware is roughly composed of the following: core, storage, peripheral interface, bus, interrupt module, clock module and so on. In the verification phase, these are implemented in verilog/VHDL code, you can not see the entity.

The SOC is a whole concept, and then refine it to each module. Before a SOC is formed, the design engineer knocks out each module with verilog/VHDL code for rough module-level verification, and after the module-level verification is passed, the modules are integrated together through a bus. At present, the more widely used bus protocol is AMBA bus, including AXI, ASB, AHB, APB. The general use is the module, and then the IP, integrated together to form a SOC chip. In the test phase, it is assumed that these IPs are good, so the verification engineers of such companies do the job of verifying connectivity, that is, verifying whether the integration is correct and whether the functionality is achieved. This verification includes the core, peripherals, buses and storage, which is also known as system-level verification. Of course, not all modules are bought, there are some small modules that you can write yourself.
