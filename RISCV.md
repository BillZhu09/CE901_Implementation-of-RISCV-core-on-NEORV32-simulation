It was first created in May 2010 by Prof. Krste Asanovi, graduate students Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman, and the Parallel Computing Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. RISCV is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA). The publication The RISC-V INSTRUCTION SET MANUAL covers the characteristics of ISA. Any implementations must offer a base integer instruction set architecture (ISA) and any further base ISA enhancements. RISC CPUs don't have branch delay slots, although they do support optional variable-length instruction encodings. The base offers a functional ISA and software toolchain that is purposefully constrained to a small amount of instructions that is adequate to serve as an acceptable destination for operating systems, connectors, assembly lines, and compilers.
