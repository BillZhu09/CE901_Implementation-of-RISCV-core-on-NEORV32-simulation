# Linux Virtual Machine

The following tutorial is from :https://www.open.edu/openlearn/pluginfile.php/729860/mod_resource/content/2/2.2.4.6%20Lab%20-%20Install%20a%20Linux%20Virtual%20Machine%20%28Optional%29.pdf

## Part 1: Prepare a Computer for Virtualization
In Part 1, you will download and install virtualization software, and acquire a bootable image of a Linux
distribution.

Step 1: Download and install the free VMware player.
There are two excellent virtualization programs that you can download and install for free, VMware Player and
VirtualBox. In this lab, you will use the VMware player.

-*a.* Go to http://vmware.com, hover the cursor over Downloads, and search for Free Product Downloads.

-*b.* Under Free Product Downloads, click Player.
The VMware Player has 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Windows and Linux. To download the software, you
must register a free user account with VMware.
Note: The Linux version of VMware Player might work on Mac OS X; if not, http://virtualbox.org has a free
version of its VirtualBox software that will run on Mac OS X.

-*c.* When you have downloaded the VMware Player installation file, run the installer and accept the default
installation settings.

## Step 2: Download a bootable image of Linux.
You need an operating system to install on your virtual machineâ€™s virtual hardware. Linux is a suitable choice
for an operating system, because most of the distributions are free to download and run. It also allows you to
explore an operating system that might be unfamiliar to you.

*a.* To download Linux, you first must select a distribution such as Mint, Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse, Debian, or
CentOS. (There are many others to choose from.) In this lab, the instructions follow an installation of
Linux Mint.

*b.* Go to http://linuxmint.com, hover over the Download button, and click Linux Mint 16 (or current version
number).

*c.* Scroll down the page until you see the version of the Mint code name, Cinnamon (or the current code
name). Choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, depending on your current operating system platform,
and click the link.
