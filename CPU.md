# CPU

The CPU is the core component that defines the computing device, but it is not the only component, it is just the brain. The chip is located in a special holder (slot) on the main circuit board (motherboard or mainplate) inside the device. It is distinctly different from memory, which stores information temporarily. It is also separate from the graphics card or graphics chip, which renders all the video and 3D graphics displayed on the screen.

The CPU is built by placing billions of tiny transistors on a single computer chip. These transistors allow it to perform calculations to run programs stored in the system memory. They are actually tiny gates that open or close, and therefore convey zero or nothing, translating into everything that is done with the device, whether it is watching a video or writing an email.

One of the most common advancements in CPU technology has been to make these transistors smaller and smaller. Over the decades, this has led to an increase in CPU speed, often referred to as Moore's Law

In nomal devices, a desktop or laptop computer has a dedicated CPU that performs many processing functions for the system. In contrast, mobile devices and some tablets use a system-on-a-chip, which contains its CPU and other components. Both Intel and AMD offer CPUs with graphics chips and memory, which means they can perform more than just standard CPU functions.

At its core, the CPU fetches instructions from a program or application and executes the computation. The process is divided into three key stages: fetching, decoding and execution. the CPU fetches the instructions from RAM, decodes what the instructions actually mean, and then executes the instructions using the relevant parts of the CPU.

The instructions or calculations performed may involve basic arithmetic, comparing certain numbers or moving them around in memory. Since everything in a computing device is represented by the number 01, these simple tasks are equivalent to the work of the CPU.

In most systems, the CPU doesn't do all the tasks, but it must still provide its required function numbers to the dedicated hardware. For example, telling the hard drive to transfer Office documents to the system's RAM for faster access.

Clock speed (frequency) effectively indicates how many instructions per second a CPU can process, but it is not an overall measure of performance. Clock speed comes into play primarily when comparing the same product family or generation of CPUs. When all else is equal, a faster clock speed means a faster processor.

The cpu still plays an important role in running the device. Since it is responsible for executing only the commands in a program, the faster the CPU, the faster many applications will run. The processor, no matter how powerful, cannot easily run the latest 3D games or store information. That's where other components (such as graphics cards and memory) come into play.

Therefore, the CPU is not everything, but it is very important. Often, a faster CPU means that your system or device will run faster. Multiple cores and threads can help your computer perform more operations at once.
