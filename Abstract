# Abstract

The RISCV microprocessor's implementation on a programmable circuit is discussed in the paper. We 
focused into the process's complexity, the processor's features, and the connectivity of the external 
devices. We choose the NEORV32 open source CPU for implementation. The current RISCV design, 
involves significant, and the relatively straightforward structures in the VHDL language of Vivado, 
which provided guidance into the processor's operation, led to the selection of the NEORV32 processor. 
It is crucial to employ effective and precise testing techniques for microprocessor designs as the price 
of developing integrated schematics, particularly in the area of microprocessors. Consider about the 
development phase, make accurate evaluation of microprocessor architectures possible. This work aims 
to illustrate the special advantages of VHDL simulation analysis in microprocessor method for 
performing. The study evaluates the RISCV infrastructure architecture, uses prng xoroshiro128+ for 
optimization, and tracks how effectively the microprocessor design fits the processor. The NEORV32 
RISC-V processor project, which is being modified and tested, has been chosen as the microprocessor 
to accomplish these objectives. The xoroshiro128+ PRNG-based benchmark was used to measure and 
test the NEORV32 CPU. This illustrates the speed and functionality of the CPU
